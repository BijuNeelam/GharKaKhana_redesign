% Chapter 5: Literature Review
\chapter{Literature Review}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

\section{Web Development Frameworks}
Next.js, a React-based framework, has become the industry standard for modern web applications \cite{nextjs2024}. It provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making it ideal for e-commerce applications.

\section{Payment Gateway Integration}
Payment gateway integration requires careful consideration of security, user experience, and compliance with PCI DSS standards \cite{paymentgateway2021}. Razorpay is a leading payment gateway in India, supporting multiple payment methods and providing comprehensive API documentation \cite{razorpay2024}.

\section{Webhook Security}
Webhook security is critical for payment processing. HMAC-SHA256 signature verification ensures that webhook requests are authentic and have not been tampered with \cite{hmac2024}. This prevents unauthorized access and payment fraud.

\section{React Patterns}
Modern React development emphasizes component reusability, proper state management, and TypeScript for type safety \cite{reactpatterns2022}. The use of hooks and functional components has become the standard approach.

\section{Serverless Architecture}
Serverless architecture provides automatic scaling and reduced operational overhead \cite{serverless2023}. Vercel's platform offers seamless deployment and hosting for Next.js applications with built-in CI/CD capabilities \cite{vercel2024}.

% Chapter 6: System Design and Architecture
